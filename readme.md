# Automate the Boring stuff with Python

## What will this Repo Contain?
In this repo I plan to store all of my projects and example code created while I learn the foundations of Python.

## Who is this repo for?
This repo is for my personal use. I plan to lean the basics of Git in parallel with Python, updating this repo as I progress through this book and lean more about Python. However, the examples created in this repository could also be helpful to anyone stuck on a section of this book or looking for inspiration. I like to continue my understanding of the book, often creating my own example use cases, beyond the examples given in the book. I also often fill out the chapter questions in a `.txt` file after completing the chapter.

## What are my goals?
- Gain a base level knowledge of Python as I complete this book.
- Learn the process of using Git as a source control program for my code.
